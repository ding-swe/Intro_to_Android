# Introductory Project with Android

#### This is an introductory Android application that teaches activities, fragments, intents and other Android fundamentals. Functionally, the application serves the user the ability to save locations and overview stats about the user's behaviors.

<b>Current State:</b>
The application consists of three separate fragments atop one main activity. Successfully mocks popular Android UI's by looking like <i>tabs</i>

<b>Next Steps:</b>

- Implement functionality in the three fragments 
- Save data to local and represent it modularly on the first fragment
- Use intents to pass information between the fragments
